*This project is part of the DSI321 BIG DATA INFRASTRUCTURE course and still ongoing.*

## Introduction
The "Real-time Air Quality Data Forecasting Pipeline with Visualization" project aims to develop a comprehensive system for orchestrating, forecasting, and visualizing air quality data in real-time with Prefect 3, Docker, and GitHub. This project is crucial for environmental monitoring, public health, and urban planning, providing stakeholders with actionable insights into air quality trends and potential hazards around Rangsit, Pathum Thani, Thailand.

We use [Air quality API](https://envilink.go.th/dataset/air-quality-pm2point5/resource/156ca885-4f38-4c58-8745-397552105c1e) to collect air quality data based on the hourly average concentration of PM2.5 from the automatic air quality monitoring stations of **Air4Thai** across Thailand. The API is managed by the Pollution Control Department of Thailand.
